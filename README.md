# COLOR CLICKY GAME

This Color Clicky Game is a memory game using React.  This application breaks the user interface into components, manages the components state, and responds to user events.  Different images are rendered on the screen with each image listening to click events. 

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of the game is to click on an image but not click on the same image more than once. The images will shuffle once an image is clicked.  Users are given points toward their score for each new image they click. If they click on an image more than once, the score will reset back at zero.
